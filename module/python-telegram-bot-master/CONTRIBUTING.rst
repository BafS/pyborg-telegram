How To Contribute
=================

Every open source project lives from the generous help by contributors that sacrifice their time and ``python-telegram-bot`` is no different.

To make participation as pleasant as possible, this project adheres to the `Code of Conduct`_ by the Python Software Foundation.

Here are a few guidelines to get you started:

- Add yourself to the AUTHORS.rst_ file in an alphabetical fashion.
  Every contribution is valuable and shall be credited.
- If your change is noteworthy, add an entry to the CHANGES_.
- No contribution is too small; please submit as many fixes for typos and grammar bloopers as you can!
- Don’t break backward compatibility.
- *Always* add tests and docs for your code.
  This is a hard rule; patches with missing tests or documentation won’t be merged.
  If a feature is not tested or documented, it doesn’t exist.
- Obey `PEP 8`_ and `PEP 257`_.
- Follow `Google Python Style Guide`_ and `Google Python Style Docstrings`_.
- Write `good commit messages`_.

.. note::
   If you have something great but aren’t sure whether it adheres -- or even can adhere -- to the rules above: **please submit a pull request anyway**!

   In the best case, we can mold it into something, in the worst case the pull request gets politely closed.
   There’s absolutely nothing to fear.
